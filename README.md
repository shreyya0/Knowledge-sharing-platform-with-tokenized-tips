# Knowledge Sharing Platform with Tokenized Tips

## Description
This project is a decentralized knowledge-sharing platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to create and share informative posts while enabling others to tip the authors using AptosCoin as a token of appreciation. The platform promotes fair compensation for knowledge-sharing in a transparent and efficient manner.

## Vision of the Project
The vision of this project is to create an open and decentralized ecosystem where knowledge-sharing is rewarded. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to remove intermediaries and ensure that content creators are directly incentivized through peer-to-peer tipping.

## Future Scope
- **Reputation System:** Implement a ranking system based on tips received.
- **NFT Integration:** Convert valuable posts into NFTs for ownership verification.
- **Community Governance:** Enable voting on featured posts and platform improvements.
- **Multi-token Support:** Extend tipping functionality to multiple cryptocurrencies.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Store posts on IPFS or a similar decentralized storage solution.
